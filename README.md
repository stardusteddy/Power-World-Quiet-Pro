my setup with an ESP32, a MAX485Converter and a stepdown converter to generate the 5V needed for ESP32 and the the RS485 board

the wiring will follow

I used on the ESP pin 16, 17 and 4 for the modbus/serial communication

The only registers wich seems toe be accessable are the holding regsiters (0x30 Mode in Modbus)
Currently for teating and finding out the meaning of the registers i read register 40000 to 40300 in batches of 50.
The frequency is every 7 aeconds all register are updated in the ESP
For writing use 0x60 with same register range.
The registers wich I already use and know what is inside are documented in the Excel.
